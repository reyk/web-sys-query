# Minimal jQuery-like API for web-sys

_jQuery is dead_ and everyone agrees that you should use a modern
approach like React instead (or, in the Rust/WASM world,
[Yew](https://crates.io/yew)].

But in case you want to port a simple jQuery application to Rust/WASM,
you can use this crate to query the rather complex
[web-sys](https://crates.io/web-sys) API with a jQuery-like syntax.
